Mobile App Design

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The app I developed is an Inventory Management App designed to help small businesses and individuals easily keep track of their inventory. The app allows users to add, update, and delete items while displaying their inventory in a simple grid layout. One of the key goals was to address the user’s need for low-stock alerts, so I included an SMS notification feature to notify users when an item’s stock is running low. The focus was on making the app user-friendly and efficient for managing inventory.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

To meet user needs, the app included several key screens: a secure login screen, an inventory grid display, and item detail screens for adding and updating items. The low-stock SMS alert feature was also necessary to help users stay on top of their inventory without constantly checking the app. The UI was designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that users could navigate the app without confusion. I focused on keeping the layout clean and intuitive, which made the design successful in terms of usability.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**

I approached the coding process by breaking down the project into smaller tasks. I started with setting up the main structure of the app, then worked on the key features like the inventory grid and the SMS alerts. I used a modular approach to keep the code organized and reusable. In the future, I can apply this same strategy to any app development project by focusing on one feature at a time and ensuring each part of the app works before moving on to the next.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

I tested the app regularly to make sure the code was functional on different devices and Android versions. I used both an emulator and manual testing to check for any bugs or issues. This testing process was important because it helped me find small errors early on, like compatibility issues with different Android versions. It also made sure the app ran smoothly before final submission.

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring compatibility across multiple Android versions, especially since I wanted the app to reach a broad audience. I had to innovate by testing on an older version of Android and refining some features, like the SMS notifications, to work on both older and newer versions. This helped me overcome the compatibility challenge and ensure the app worked well on different devices.

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I’m particularly proud of how I demonstrated my skills in creating a clean and functional UI while ensuring that the app’s core features, like the SMS notifications, worked as intended. The balance between user-centered design and functionality shows my ability to develop apps that meet real user needs.
